# docker-nginx

This set up provides static content, 
rewrite of URLs, 
and some proxying of other services.

I use it alongside a Caddy reverse proxy,
and in there is a comprehensive list of all
the URLs that I have to support.

In Github, see Wildsong/docker-caddy-proxy "Test cases" in the README.
